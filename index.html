                <p><em>THE FUTURE CEO OF<strong><a href="https://www.google.co.in/"> GOOGLE</a> (INSHALLAH) </strong></em></p><br>
                <p>My name is Mohammed Akram , MY dream is to work at google Inshallah.I am a part time web developer and this is my first time writing code of which i am proud of.<br>Inshallah I wish to become an excellent developer and hope to make this as my career. At first I wantede to start with making IOS apps.<br>
                     But then I realized I neede apple computers or laptops in order to do that,but sadly I  did not have that so I switched to an android devlopement Course.<br>
                     But again sadly My pc could not load android studio and when I finally had got it running it lagged a lot so then I realized why waste time and switched to web delopement.<br>
                     The only thing that kept me going was my interest in computers and my faith also that we must try until we succeed.And my course is still going on Alhamdullilah.<br>
                     Currently I am 14 yrs old and preparing for one of the toughest exams in this world JEE Advanced which will grant me a seat in IITs.Inshallah.</p></td>
